                            <li>Whole grains such as whole wheat bread, pasta and brown rice.</li>

                            <li>Vegetables such as spinach, broccoli and bell peppers which are rich in vitamins and antioxidants.</li>

                            <li>Fat free or low fat dairy products such as milk, yogurt, and cheese.</li>
                            <li>Other protein-rich foods such as eggs, beans and legumes.</li>

                        <h2>Stay hydrated</h2>
                        <P>Drinking water is a core element of your physical health. Water regulates your body temperature and keeps your joints well-lubricated. It also removes toxins from your body via urination and bowel movements.</P>
                        <ul class="list-health">
                            <li>The recommended amount of water to drink each day will vary from person to person, but general guidelines suggest 13 cups of water for men and 9 cups of water for women every day</li>
                            <li>To get in the habit of drinking more water, keep a bottle of water on your desk. Seeing the water in close proximity will probably prompt you to drink it more often, but you can also set your phone or computer to give you a reminder every half hour to drink.</li>
                            <li>If you are in the habit of drinking soda, try drinking sparkling water instead. The fizzy, carbonated texture of the drink will remind you of soda, but you won't be consuming any of the harmful sugars or chemicals from soda.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <P class="wrong-health">Foods that should be eaten rarely or in moderation include sodas, fried foods, full-fat dairy products, sugary processed foods like cookies, cakes and cereals. Eating these calorie-laden foods in excess could cause you to become overweight or obese, increasing your risk of heart disease, diabetes and other serious health conditions.</P>
                        <span class="wrong-health">You should also limit your intake of caffeine and alcoholic drinks.</span>

                        <h2>Exercise</h2>
                        <P>You don't have to compete in Ultra-Marathons in order to reap the physical benefits of exercise. 30 minutes of moderate to intense exercise (like brisk walking, running, swimming or hiking) 4-5 times a week is the recommended amount for most people.</P>
                        <ul class="list-health">
                            <li>Exercise can help you lose weight and reduce your risk of suffering from heart disease, diabetes, chronic fatigue, and even some cancers, such as endometrial and lung cancer.</li>
                            <li>It may take some time to find a form of exercise you really enjoy. Try a wide variety of activities: walking, running, swimming, yoga, pilates, ballet. You can also look into team sports such as soccer, basketball, football, and softball. Your local gym or community center may offer classes in these areas, but you can also look for DVDs or fitness videos on YouTube to give you guidance.</li>
                            <li>Don't give up on a new exercise regime immediately. It will take time for your muscles to adjust to the demands of the activity. Try each activity for at least a month before you move onto something new.</li>

                        <h2>Sleep 7 to 9 hours every night</h2>
                        <P>A full night's sleep can have multiple physical benefits, from boosting your immune system to improving your ability to concentrate and complete projects when you are awake.</P>
                        <ul class="list-health">
                            <li>If you struggle to get a full night's sleep, try creating a regular bedtime routine in the hour leading up to the time you want to sleep. Wash your face, brush your teeth, and play some relaxing music. You might read a book in bed before going to sleep. Repeating these activities will prepare your body for sleep.</li>
                            <li>Improve your sleeping conditions. If you need to sleep in a cool room, add an extra fan or remove a layer of blankets from your bed. If you live by a noisy street, try using a white noise machine to drown out any noise. Use thick curtains to shut out any light from street lamps or nearby buildings.</li>

                        <P>Brush your teeth in the morning and in the evening for two minutes each time. Use a fluoride-based toothpaste. Your dentist may want you to brush after every meal or 3 times a day, so always follow her directions.</P>
